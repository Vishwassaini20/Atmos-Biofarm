BioFarm - AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System
BioFarm is an AI-powered web application designed to help farmers predict the best crops to plant based on soil conditions, weather patterns, and other agricultural parameters. The system utilizes machine learning to analyze data such as soil pH, temperature, rainfall, and more, to recommend the optimal crop for a given region.

Features:
Crop Recommendation: Based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the application recommends the best crop to plant.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be easy to use for farmers with no technical expertise.
Data-Driven Insights: Uses advanced machine learning models to process data and provide accurate predictions.
How It Works:
User Input: The user inputs key parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
Model Processing: The system processes the inputs using a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the most suitable crop.
Recommendation Output: The system displays the recommended crop for the user to plant, improving agricultural decision-making.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web development)
Backend: Flask (Python-based framework for handling web requests and serving the model)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for creating and deploying the crop recommendation model)
Data Handling: Pandas (for data processing)
